Analyzing the dataset on prison population per year in the United States reveals significant fluctuations over the past three years. In 2019, the total prison population stood at 1,435,093 individuals, decreasing to 1,213,073 in 2020, and further declining to 1,199,642 in 2021. Washington state similarly experienced a decline in prison population, with 19,160 individuals incarcerated in 2019, decreasing to 15,644 in 2020, and further dropping to 13,457 in 2021. However, despite these overall declines, racial disparities persist, notably in the incarceration levels of Black and White individuals. In 2021, for instance, the incarceration rate for Black individuals in the United States was 5.6 times higher than that of White individuals, with approximately 1,038,100 Black individuals incarcerated compared to 185,900 White individuals. These findings underscore the ongoing need to address systemic inequalities within the criminal justice system and implement reform measures aimed at reducing mass incarceration and promoting equitable outcomes.
